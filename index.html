	<p>My name is Elijah J. Mears, and I am a proud lifelong resident of North Carolina. I was born January 3, 1995, so I share a birthday with both J.R.R. Tolkien and Marcus Tullius Cicero. I grew up in Cary but consider Greensboro my home since moving here for school in 2013. I am a member of the Young Democrats of Guilford County, Director of Communications for the <a href="http://uncgdemocrats.com" target=_blank >UNCG Democrats</a>, and a former field organizer for a local city council campaign. Labor rights, LGBT rights, climate change, and public transportation access are all issues which I feel very passionate about and consider myself an advocate for.</p>

	<p>I am currently wrapping up my 5<sup>th</sup> and final year as a Classical Languages & Literature major at UNC Greensboro, with an eye toward graduate school after taking a gap year. My hobbies include writing, photography, web design, and conlanging. I have had poetry published in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Coraddi</span>, UNCG&rsquo;s literary magazine, and I recently had <a href="https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/papersandpubs/vol6/iss1/5/" target=_blank>an article</a> published in a peer-reviewed undergraduate journal. I currently work as the Web Content Manager for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Carolinian</span>, UNCG&rsquo;s student newspaper, and I also do freelance graphics work on the side.</p>
